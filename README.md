# Buzz My Brand - Influencer Post Tracker

Hey there! üëã Welcome to the Buzz My Brand Influencer Post Tracker. This is a modern web app I've been building to help track and manage influencer campaign posts across different social media platforms.

## What's This All About?

Managing influencer campaigns can be a real headache - keeping track of who's posting what, when they're posting, and how those posts are performing. That's why I created this tool to make life easier for anyone managing influencer campaigns.

## Tech Stack & Tools Used

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for that clean, modern look
- **Development Tools**:
  - GPT-4 for planning and organizing the project structure
  - Cursor Pro for the actual coding (it's been amazing!)

## Current Features

Here's what we've got working so far:

### Core Features
- üîç Smart search functionality for finding influencers quickly
- üìä Status tracking for each post (Posted, Needs Approval, Script Needed)
- üìà View tracking with both total campaign views and current views
- üì± Platform support for both Instagram and TikTok

### UI/UX
- Clean, modern interface with a focus on usability
- Responsive design that works great on all devices
- Status indicators with color coding for easy visual reference
- Full-width layout for better data visibility

### Data Management
- Add and edit influencer details
- Track up to 4 videos per influencer
- Monitor view counts and performance metrics
- Filter influencers by status

## What's Next?

I'm actively working on adding more features, including:
- Analytics dashboard with detailed performance metrics
- More detailed video performance tracking
- Enhanced filtering and sorting options
- Export functionality for reports

## Getting Started

(Coming soon - I'll add setup instructions once we're ready for deployment!)

## Development Notes

This project has been an interesting journey of combining different tools and approaches:

1. Using GPT-4 for planning and architecture decisions has helped maintain a clear vision
2. Cursor Pro has been fantastic for the actual coding work
3. The combination of Next.js and Tailwind has made it possible to create a modern, responsive interface quickly
