## What's Next?

I'm actively working on adding more features, including:

- Enhanced filtering and sorting options

(Coming soon - I'll add setup instructions once we're ready for deployment!)

## Development Notes

This project has been an interesting journey of combining different tools and approaches:

1. Using GPT-4 for planning and architecture decisions has helped maintain a clear vision
2. Cursor Pro has been great for the actual coding work
3. The combination of Next.js and Tailwind has made it possible to create a modern, responsive interface quickly
4. Total development time from zero to completion: approximately 4 hours - probably would have been faster if I had more context had a few confusing things like 'views now' and also if I hadn't added some extra stuff for myself.
5. Made a lot of new changes for real-world.
